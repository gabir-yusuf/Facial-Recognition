- before you start runing this code make sure you have install all the requirements before so open the terminal and activate conda enviroment then run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- This did this code on Google Colab. in this case you will not need to install any requirments because it's already installed.
- If you will use Colab (**Recommended**) open the [project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PJ2pf1TozL1RlumXrnCo1n9jQueoTAWH) and run the code directly
